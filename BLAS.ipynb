    "* How does this code compare in complexity to the code you wrote for Stack and Queue?\n",
    "The code in boost_matrix.cc  is way simpler, but that's probably because it uses things that are already defined. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Explain what the notation <type> means in, e.g., complex<long double>.\n",
    "The notation signifies what type the objects within the complex number are, here it's a long double.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Are BLAS matrices row-major or column-major? How can you tell based on how the code is written?\n",
    "It's row-major, because when you  loop through them you go by rows first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a new program that uses BLAS to create a complex plane in a similar way to your python code from before. Print the resulting matrix of complex numbers to the screen in a pretty way to demonstrate that your code works.\n"
